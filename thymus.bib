   abstract = {Foundation species create complex habitats in which associated organisms find refuge from biological and physical stress; these foundation species are thus fundamental to the structure and resilience of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In the present article, we develop an approach to understanding foundation species' effects in communities that are maintained not by a single foundation species, as has been the focus of research to date, but by multiple, co-occurring foundation species. Using examples from diverse ecosystems, we illustrate the prevalence of multiple-foundation-species assemblages and hypothesize that the nature of foundation-species interactions has important consequences for community structure. We predict where positive and negative interactions among foundation species will occur and suggest that they organize communities hierarchically in nested or adjacent assemblages that underlie landscape-scale patterns in species distribution. Elucidating the predictable nature of foundation-species interactions may be key to understanding and managing the biodiversity and functioning of many ecosystems.},

abstract = {Lung branching morphogenesis has been widely studied in the field of developmental biology. Lung airway trees consist of relatively regular-sized distal branches, but how this regular branched pattern is formed is not well understood. In the present study, we undertake a detailed mathematical analysis of the model proposed in (Hartmann \& Miura (2006), which numerically captures branching morphogenesis of the simplest possible experimental system in vitro. We investigate analytically the stability of 1D travelling waves with respect to periodic perturbations in two dimensions. This linear stability analysis leads to the so-called dispersion relations, predicting that a certain representative length dominates in this model. As the analytical analysis is restricted to travelling waves, we generalize the linear analysis to any 1D solution by numerical simulations. Both results predict how the representative lengths will change by experimentally changing specific parameters. Finally, we discuss the importance of the analytical results from a biological point of view and propose an experimental scheme for a quantitative comparison between experiments and theory.},

abstract = {Vertebrate lung has tree-like structure which facilitates gas exchange. After discovery of the involvement of several key toolkit genes-FGF10, BMP4, and Shh, huge amount of molecular information on lung development is now available. However, how their interactions result in a branched structure has not been elucidated. Recently, some studies have utilized mathematical models to understand the mechanism of branching morphogenesis, and we now have some models which are reliable enough to make experimental predictions in the in vitro system. In addition, a different type of modeling, which generates tree-like branching pattern by repeatedly applying a set of simple rules iteratively, is also utilized to model lung function. In this review, I focus on how these models can contribute to understand pattern formation phenomena from experimental biologist's point of view. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dillencourt92,
abstract = {An improved and general approach to connected-component labeling of images is presented.  The algorithm presented in this paper processes images in predetermined order, which means that the processing order depends only on the image representation scheme and not on specific properties of the image.  The algorithm handles a wide variety of image representation schemes (rasters, run lengths, quadtrees, bintrees, etc.).  How to adapt the standard UNION-FIND algorithm to permit reuse of temporary labels is shown.  This is done using a technique called age balancing, in which, when two labels are merged, the older label becomes the father of the younger label.  This technique can be made to coexist with the more conventional rule of weight balancing, in which the label with more descendants becomes the father of the label with fewer descendants.  Various image scanning orders are examined and classified.  It is also shown that when the algorithm is specialized to a pixel array scanned in raster order, the total processing time is linear in the number of pixels.  The linear-time processing time follows from a special property of the UNION-FIND algorithm, which may be of independent interest.  This property states that under certain restrictions on the input, UNION-FIND runs in time linear in the number of FIND and UNION operations.  Under these restrictions, linear-time performance can be achieved without resorting to the more complicated Gabow-Tarjan algorithm for disjoint set union.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High content screening techniques are increasingly used to understand the regulation and progression of cell motility. The demand of new platforms, coupled with availability of terabytes of data has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual methods and resulted in development of high-dimensional analytical methods. RESULTS: In this paper, we present sub-populations analysis of cells at the tissue level by using dynamic features of the cells. We used active contour without edges for segmentation of cells, which preserves the cell morphology, and autoregressive modeling to model cell trajectories. The sub-populations were obtained by clustering static, dynamic and a combination of both features. We were able to identify three unique sub-populations in combined clustering. CONCLUSION: We report a novel method to identify sub-populations using kinetic features and demonstrate that these features improve sub-population analysis at the tissue level. These advances will facilitate the application of high content screening data analysis to new and complex biological problems.},

We used aire- deficient mice to test the hypothesis that this transcription factor regulates autoimmunity by promoting the ectopic expression of peripheral tissue- restricted antigens in medullary epithelial cells of the thymus. This hypothesis proved correct. The mutant animals exhibited a defined profile of autoimmune diseases that depended on the absence of aire in stromal cells of the thymus. Aire-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells showed a specific reduction in ectopic transcription of genes encoding peripheral antigens. These findings highlight the importance of thymically imposed "central" tolerance in controlling autoimmunity.},

@article{Gillard07,
abstract = {The prevalent view of thymic epithelial differentiation and Aire activity holds that Aire functions in terminally differentiated medullary thymic epithelial cells (MTECs) to derepress the expression of structural tissue-restricted Ags, including pancreatic endocrine hormones. An alternative view of these processes has proposed that Aire functions to regulate the differentiation of immature thymic epithelial cells, thereby affecting tissue-restricted Ag expression and negative selection. In this study, we demonstrate that Aire impacts several aspects of murine MTECs and provide support for this second model. Expression of transcription factors associated with developmental plasticity of progenitor cells, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, by MTECs was Aire dependent. Similarly, the transcription factors that regulate pancreatic development and the expression of pancreatic hormones are also expressed by wild-type MTECs in an Aire-dependent manner. The altered transcriptional profiles in Aire-deficient MTECs were accompanied by changes in the organization and composition of the medullary epithelial compartment, including a reduction in the medullary compartment defined by keratin (K) 14 expression, altered patterns of K5 and K8 expression, and more prominent epithelial cysts. These findings implicate Aire in the regulation of MTEC differentiation and the organization of the medullary thymic compartment and are compatible with a role for Aire in thymic epithelium differentiation.},

abstract = {The roles of autoimmune regulator (Aire) in the expression of the diverse arrays of tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) genes from thymic epithelial cells in the medulla (medullary thymic epithelial cells [mTECs]) and in organization of the thymic microenvironment are enigmatic. We approached this issue by creating a mouse strain in which the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into the Aire locus in a manner allowing concomitant disruption of functional Aire protein expression. We found that Aire(+) (i.e., GFP(+)) mTECs were the major cell types responsible for the expression of Aire-dependent TRA genes such as insulin 2 and salivary protein 1, whereas Aire-independent TRA genes such as C-reactive protein and glutamate decarboxylase 67 were expressed from both Aire(+) and Aire(-) mTECs. Remarkably, absence of Aire from mTECs caused morphological changes together with altered distribution of mTECs committed to Aire expression. Furthermore, we found that the numbers of mTECs that express involucrin, a marker for terminal epidermal differentiation, were reduced in Aire-deficient mouse thymus, which was associated with nearly an absence of Hassall's corpuscle-like structures in the medulla. Our results suggest that Aire controls the differentiation program of mTECs, thereby organizing the global mTEC integrity that enables TRA expression from terminally differentiated mTECs in the thymic microenvironment.},

We show that the chemokine receptor XCR1 is expressed by tDCs, whereas medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) express the ligand XCL1. XCL1-deficient mice are defective in the medullary accumulation of tDCs and the thymic generation of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nT reg cells). Thymocytes from XCL1-deficient mice elicit dacryoadenitis in nude mice. mTEC expression of XCL1, tDC medullary accumulation, and nT reg cell generation are diminished in Aire-deficient mice.
